# üìä Retail Analytics Dashboard

## üîß Project Overview

This end-to-end project simulates a real-world retail sales analytics pipeline. It showcases a full BI solution using raw CSV data, SQL-based ETL, dimensional data modeling (star schema), and a Power BI dashboard to extract and visualize key business insights.

---

## üìÜ Business Objectives

* Track and analyze overall sales performance against targets
* Identify top-performing products and categories
* Evaluate customer segments based on gender, age, and city
* Monitor regional sales trends and underperforming stores
* Support inventory decision-making (Dim\_Inventory added for future scope)

---

## üìä Data Pipeline Architecture

### üîπ 1. Data Ingestion

* `retail_raw_feed.csv` loaded into staging table (`stg_raw_feed`) using `BULK INSERT`

### üîπ 2. Dimensional Modeling (Star Schema)

* **Fact\_Sales**: Core transaction data
* **Dim\_Product**: Product details
* **Dim\_Customer**: Age, gender, location
* **Dim\_Store**: Store metadata
* **Dim\_Calendar**: Time dimension (by date)
* **Dim\_Inventory**: Current stock per store-product (added for extended use cases)

### üîπ 3. ETL Workflow

* SQL scripts created for schema creation, data staging, dimensional loads, and fact population
* All transformations handled using stored procedures and `INSERT INTO ... SELECT` logic

## üß∞ Key Insights

*  Revenue fell short of target despite exceeding unit sales (+7.1%)
*  Q3 is the best-performing quarter; seasonal patterns observed in Q2 & Q4
* üë© 26‚Äì35 year-olds and female customers generate the highest spend
* üè¢ West region (e.g., Mumbai, Pune) leads across all quarters
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Lower AOV suggests high volume in lower-value SKUs; upsell opportunities exist

---

## üìä Data-Driven Recommendations

* Focus marketing efforts on 26‚Äì35 age group and female customer segments
* Bundle low-value products to boost AOV
* Investigate underperformance in Central region stores
* Align stock and staffing strategy with seasonal sales trends (Q2/Q4)
